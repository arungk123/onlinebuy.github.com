<h1> Welcome to my page </h1>
<p> As with any area of knowledge, the web comes with a lot of jargon. Don't worry, we won't overwhelm you with all of it (we have a glossary if you're curious). However, there are a few basic terms you need to understand at the outset, since you'll hear these expressions all the time as you read on. It's easy to confuse these terms sometimes since they refer to related but different functionalities. In fact, you'll sometimes see these terms misused in news reports and elsewhere, so getting them mixed up is understandable!

We'll cover these terms and technologies in more detail as we explore further, but these quick definitions will be a great start for you:</p>

<h3>web page</h3>
A document which can be displayed in a web browser such as Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera, Microsoft Internet Explorer or Edge, or Apple's Safari. These are also often called just "pages."
<h3>website</h3>
A collection of web pages which are grouped together and usually connected together in various ways. Often called a "web site" or a "site."
<h3>web server</h3>
A computer that hosts a website on the Internet.
<h3>search engine</h3>
<p>A web service that helps you find other web pages, such as Google, Bing, Yahoo, or DuckDuckGo.</p> 
<p>Search engines are normally accessed through a web browser (e.g. you can perform search engine searches directly in the address bar of Firefox, Chrome, etc.) or through a web page (e.g. bing.com or duckduckgo.com).</p>
<p>Let's look at a simple analogy â€” a public library. This is what you would generally do when visiting a library:</p>

<p>Find a search index and look for the title of the book you want.</p>
<p>Make a note of the catalog number of the book.</p>
<p>Go to the particular section containing the book, find the right catalog number, and get the book.</p>
<p>Let's compare the library with a web server:</p>

<p>The library is like a web server. It has several sections, which is similar to a web server hosting multiple websites.
The different sections (science, math, history, etc.) in the library are like websites. Each section is like a unique website (two sections do not contain same books).
The books in each section are like webpages. One website may have several webpages, e.g., the Science section (the website) will have books on heat, sound, thermodynamics, statics, etc. (the webpages). Webpages can each be found at a unique location (URL).
The search index is like the search engine. Each book has its own unique location in the library (two books cannot be kept at the same place) which is specified by the catalog number.<p>
